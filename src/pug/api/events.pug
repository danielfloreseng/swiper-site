p Swiper comes with a bunch of useful events you can listen. Events can be assigned in two ways:
ol
  li
    p Using <code>on</code> parameter on swiper initialization:
    p
      :code(lang="js")
        var mySwiper = new Swiper('.swiper-container', {
          // ...
          on: {
            init: function () {
              console.log('swiper initialized');
            },
          },
        };
  li
    p Using <code>on</code> method after swiper initialization.
    p
      :code(lang="js")
        var mySwiper = new Swiper('.swiper-container', {
          // ...
        };
        mySwiper.on('slideChange', function () {
          console.log('slide changed');
        });
.important-note
  p Please note, that <code>this</code> keyword within event handler always points to Swiper instance

        p Event will be fired right after Swiper initialization. Note that with <code>swiper.on('init')</code> syntax it will work only in case you set <code>init: false</code> parameter:
        pre
          code
            :code(lang="js")
              var swiper = new Swiper('.swiper-container', {
                init: false,
                // other parameters
              })
              swiper.on('init', function() { /* do something */ });
              // init Swiper
              swiper.init();
        p Otherwise use it as the parameter:
        pre
          code
            :code(lang="js")
              var swiper = new Swiper('.swiper-container', {
                // other parameters
                on: {
                  init: function () {
                    /* do something */
                  },
                }
